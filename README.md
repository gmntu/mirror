This work demonstrates the potential of **dynamic** hand pose estimation using a **multi-view** setup with a readily available **color camera** and **plane mirrors**.

All the videos are captured on a mobile phone and post-processed on a computer to generate the 2D hand keypoints with bounding box of the hand (left column) and 3D hand skeleton projected onto the individual view (right column).

## Qualitative Results
